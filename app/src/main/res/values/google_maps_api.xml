    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    39:61:48:D2:F7:53:81:11:E8:9E:52:E6:55:58:C3:D9:65:50:C4:D2

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
